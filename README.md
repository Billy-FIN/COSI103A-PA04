Reflection:
1. All done by myself.
2. Finish it in approximately 2 days.
3. I spent a lot of time on debugging groupByCategory and sortByDate. groupByCategory: I couldn't directly match userID due to Bson version problem(the problem of databese I believe?), so I used another way to screen out user's transaction instead of every transaction stored in the database. sortByDate: just want to achieve a nice format and, in the meantime, it can be sorted and updated the date automatically after editing.
4. I want to say doing this project is much more difficult than what I expected. Programming and handling the Express is quite different from just watching Tim coding. By doing this project, I have a chance to consolidate the knowledge and skills of Express with MongoDB, including how a web app works and how to interact with a server or database.
